Certainly! Filling the Team section as a solo founder is a common scenario, and there are effective ways to present your team to investors even if you're currently the only full-time member. Here are some options:

---

### **Option 1: Highlight Your Own Expertise**

- **Emphasize Your Experience**: Focus on your skills, background, and achievements that make you uniquely qualified to lead Stoky. Highlight your expertise in AI, trading technologies, and any previous entrepreneurial ventures.

- **Multiple Roles**: Since you're handling various aspects of the business, you can list yourself in multiple capacities (e.g., Founder, CEO, Lead Developer) to show your versatility and dedication.

---

### **Option 2: Include Advisors and Mentors**

- **Advisory Board**: If you have mentors or advisors who provide guidance, include them in your Team section. This could be experts in AI, finance, trading, or business development.

- **Benefits**: Including advisors adds credibility and shows that you have a support network of experienced professionals.

---

### **Option 3: Feature Key Contributors**

- **Freelancers and Contractors**: If you've worked with freelance developers, designers, or marketers who contribute significantly to Stoky, you can mention them as part of your extended team.

- **Part-Time Team Members**: Include any part-time staff who play critical roles in your operations.

---

### **Option 4: Outline Future Team Plans**

- **Hiring Roadmap**: Present your plans to expand the team in the near future, specifying key positions you intend to fill and how they will contribute to growth.

- **Demonstrate Foresight**: This shows investors you understand the importance of building a robust team and have a strategy in place.

### **Regarding Including GPT-4 as an AI Teammate**

While it's creative to consider GPT-4 (or any AI model) as part of your team, it's generally not advisable to list an AI as a team member in a pitch deck. Investors expect to see human team members who are responsible for strategy, decision-making, and execution.

**Instead, you can:**

- **Highlight AI Technology in Product Sections**: Emphasize how GPT-4 powers Stoky's features in the product or technology section of your pitch deck.

- **Showcase Technological Edge**: Discuss how leveraging advanced AI models like GPT-4 gives Stoky a competitive advantage.
