### 1. **Add the 3 Platforms to the Website:**
   You can place the **three platforms** (StokyGPT, TelegramBot, and Strategy Studio) under the **"Powerful Features for Active Traders"** section or create a dedicated section for them just below the **pricing plans**.

   #### Suggested Section:
   Title: **"Choose Your Platform"**

   **Example Layout:**
   - **StokyGPT (Free)**:
     - **Description**: Start your trading journey with our custom GPT assistant, offering basic backtesting and community insights.
     - **CTA**: "Learn More" (links to more details or the free trial)
     - **Visual**: A GPT chat interface with a trading conversation mockup.

   - **TelegramBot (Paid Plans)**:
     - **Description**: Unlock advanced features, including real-time alerts and strategy optimization, right from Telegram.
     - **CTA**: "See Pricing Plans"
     - **Visual**: Telegram screen showcasing alerts, backtesting, and market analysis.

   - **Strategy Studio (Coming Soon)**:
     - **Description**: Build and optimize your trading strategies with our powerful Strategy Studio, designed for Pro users.
     - **CTA**: "Coming Soon" (with an option to join the waitlist)
     - **Visual**: A preview of the strategy-building UI with multiple charts and options.

   **Positioning**: 
   - **Option 1**: Add this section **just below the "Powerful Features for Active Traders"** section for immediate visibility.
   - **Option 2**: Place this section **after the pricing plans** so users can see the platforms and then relate them to the plan they choose.

### 2. **Add 'Private Cloud / On-Prem Deployment' to the Enterprise Plan**:
   In the **pricing plan section**, under the **Enterprise** plan, add a bullet point for **Private Cloud / On-Prem Deployment**.

   #### Changes to Enterprise Plan (Example):

   - **Enterprise (Custom Pricing)**:
     - All Pro features
     - Dedicated account manager
     - **Private Cloud / On-Prem Deployment** (New addition)
     - Custom integrations
     - On-site deployment (if applicable)

   **Visual/Design Tip**: 
   - You could use a small icon next to the new bullet point (e.g., a server/cloud icon) to make it stand out more. 
   - If the Enterprise plan box has enough space, emphasize **Private Cloud / On-Prem Deployment** by making it bold.

### Updated Pricing Section Example (Enterprise Plan):
```plaintext
Enterprise
Custom

All Pro features
Dedicated account manager
Private Cloud / On-Prem Deployment
Custom integrations
On-site deployment

```

By adding **Private Cloud / On-Prem** to the Enterprise plan, it will cater to more advanced clients who need dedicated infrastructure for security, compliance, or performance reasons.

### Next Steps:

- Update the **Enterprise Plan** with **Private Cloud / On-Prem** support.
- Adjust your **call to actions (CTAs)** to reflect the new platforms and their statuses (StokyGPT live, TelegramBot for paying plans, Strategy Studio coming soon).
